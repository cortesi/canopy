- Actions
  - For event handlers, we need the following variants:
    - Ignore
      - with_skip()
    - Skip
    - Handle
      - with_action()
      - with_broadcast()
      - and_continue()

  - Types
    - Broadcast (user channel, tick)
    - Event (fired on path to root of tree if generated by event handler)
- Explicit colors - at the moment, we can only get colors from our color scheme
- Add a built-in Color abstraction
- Ergonomics:
  - Better EventOutcome
  - Better error returns
- Key binding management system
- ctrl-c/ctrl-z
- text line widget
- Better debugging and monitoring story
  - Functions to dump the tree of nodes
    - Define name() for all built-in node types
  - Log-to-file
  - Add node names for relevant errors
  - Improve the test render backend
    - At the moment, it's only client is the internal code, so it only implements
      logging of text. We should make it more complete for general use.
  - Benchmarking and integration tests


User traps
  - Not implementing layout if a node has children
  - Not remembering both layout and taint after making a node modification
  - Not remembering to clear unused space
  - Not remembering to implement children and children_mut


Bugs
  - Pressing "a" repeatedly in focusgym crashes
  - Frame active bar changes height during scroll
