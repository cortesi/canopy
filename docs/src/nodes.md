# Nodes

Each node in a Canopy application tree implements three important traits:
[StatefulNode](doc/canopy/trait.StatefulNode.html), [CommandNode](doc/canopy/commands/trait.CommandNode.html) and
[Node](doc/canopy/trait.Node.html). In the sections ahead we'll take a closer look at each of these traits and their
functions.
