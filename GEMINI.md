# Core Guidelines

- Never commit code without explicit user confirmation. Just because the
  user has consented to one commit doesn't mean they consent to all future commits.
- When removing or changing code, never add comments about what was removed or
  changed. Comments in the code should always reflect what's there in the moment.
- You are an autonomous agent. You make use of all the tools available to you.
  You run instrument code and run tests and smoketests to gather information to
  solve problems. You iterate persistently until your requirements are met.
- You may create temporary files and directories as needed to solve problems,
  but always place them in the `./tmp/` directory.
- ALWAYS lint and fix all warnings before returning to the user.
- As a final step, ALWAYS format code before returning to the user.
- Adding an environment variable to configure code, enable/disable features,
  enable debugging output is almost always the wrong approach. Prefer function
  parameters or configuration structs.
- Adding sleeps or timeouts to code is nearly ALWAYS the wrong approach. Prefer
  using synchronization primitives, callbacks, or event-driven mechanisms.
  Never try to "fix" test failures by tinkering with timeouts or sleeps, and
  treat every construction of an arbitrary timeout as a code smell.
- DO NOT over-use conditional compilation. Every time you're tempted to add
  `#[cfg(...)]` to your code, ask yourself if there's a better way to structure
  the code so that it doesn't need to be conditionally compiled. Consider
  refactoring the code to extend APIs to avoid it.
- In general, prefer not to write things yourself if there's a well-known,
  well-maintained library that does what you need. Always check for existing
  libraries before implementing functionality from scratch.
- Unless specified, backwards compatibility is not a concern. You may change APIs,
  remove deprecated code, and refactor existing code as needed to improve
  quality and maintainability.


# Active API Tending

Continuously improve internal and external APIs as we work. Every time you
touch a piece of code, consider both the API it is part of and the API it
interacts with, and whether either needs to be actively tended. A good API is:

- Minimal, and without unnecessary surface area.
- Consistent in naming, structure and behavior.
- Elegantly and clearly expresses the INTENT of the code.
- Does not expose implementation details.

Internal APIs should be designed with the same care as public APIs. 

When writing Rust, use `ruskel` to inspect the API surface area of the crate or
module you're working on. Consider the API skeleton provided by `ruskel` in the
abstract, and consider if it's a good encapsuation of the intent of the API.

You may make contained improvements to the APIs as part of an unrelated patch.
Bring larger API changes to the user's attention or add them to the checklist
for explicit approval.

Examples of tending to the API include:

- Removing or making private functions that are not needed. 
- Consolidating traits, structs or functions that are similar.
- Adding better abstractions to express intent.
- Generalizing or specializing functions to improve ergonomics.

Every time you've tended the API, include an "API Tending" section in your
response message describing what you've done and what your API thought process
was.

# Active Code Maintenance

Every time you touch a piece of code, evaluate whether it can be improved
structurally. Ask questions like:

- Is the documentation for this function clear, concise and acccurate?
- Should the code be broken up into smaller pieces?
- Can the code be generalized or made more flexible?
- Can related code be refactored to share functionality?
- Is there a generic or utility function that could be extracted and used more
  widely?
- Should the code be moved to a different location in the project?

Improve code continuously when opportunities arise, even if the user hasn't
explicitly asked for it. When you do active maintenance, include an "Active
Maintenance" section in your response message.

# Active Complexity Reduction

You will actively reduce complexity in the code you touch, wherever possible.
Complexity reduction may take the form of:

- Removing a layer of indirection. For instance, if a function is simply
  forwarding to another function without adding value, remove the forwarding
  function and have callers call the target function directly.
- Removing a layer of abstraction. For instance, if a trait is only
  implemented by one struct, consider removing the trait and having callers
  depend on the struct directly.
- Amalgamating two similar functions or structs into one.
- Shifting implementation of a function only used in one place into the caller.
- Making a function more generic to reduce the need for multiple similar functions.

Complexity reduction is a primary goal so prioritize it highly. When you reduce
complexity, include a "Complexity Reduction" section in your
response message describing what you've done and why.


# Checklists

Whenever you're asked to produce a todo list or a checklist, you will use a
Markdown checklist, with numbered sections and items. Each item should be a
single, coherent change that leaves the system in a consistent state. Try not
to leave a broken system after any step, but certainly after a stage all tests
and smoketests must pass. Always include enough information that you could pick
it up again with zero context. Always wrap at 100 chars.

The checklist is a LIVE DOCUMENT, update it as you go - if you discover new
items during your work or leave items for a later commit, add them to the
checklist. Ensure that any new item you add is a also Markdown checklist item
(i.e. starts with `[ ]`), and has a number in sequence with other items in the
document. You should evaluate next steps continuously, and modify the checklist 
to incorporate what you learn as you work.

You may batch together todo items that you think belong in the same changeset
without prompting me. After every batch, let me review the code before
committing. 

IMMEDIATELY tick off each item in the original checklist file on disk as you
complete them, so we don't lose track of where we are. Don't confuse your own
checklist with the user's checklist - update both your internal checklist and
the checklist on disk.

EVERY time you are implementing a checklist, include a section titled
"Checklist Adjustments" that describes any changes you made to future items in
in the checklist. Be flexible to changing the checklist as you learn more about
the project during execution

Example format:

```markdown
# Task description

Here is the context needed to understand the task, and an outline of its broad
aims.

1. Stage One: Frobnitz the flange

Perhaps some explanation and comments go here.

1. [ ] Do a thing!
2. [ ] Do thing two.

3. Stage Two: Retrofit the turbo-enabulator

Perhaps some explanation and comments go here.

1. [ ] Second section thing.
2. [ ] Second section thing 2.
```

# Git Commits 

Never commit until you're asked to do so, or the user has explicitly confirmed
they want to commit (the user will say "commit" or "do a git commit" or some
variant of that). Make git commit messages concise and clear. In the body of
the message, provide a concise summary of what's been done, but leave out
details like the validation process. Commit as the user - don't add model
attribution or co-authorship.

First, review the actual changes that are being committed.

```sh
# 1) Review, then stage explicitly (paths or -A).
git status --porcelain

# If necessary, review changes before staging:
git diff 
```

Formulate your commit message, based on the actual diff and the user's
instructions that lead up to this point. Make sure your message covers all
changed code, not just the user's latest prompt.

Next, stage and commit:

```sh
# Stage changes; use -A to stage all changes, or specify paths.
git add -A  # or: git add <paths>

# Commit via stdin; Conventional Commit subject (≤50). Body optional; blank
# line before body; quoted heredoc prevents interpolation.
git commit --cleanup=strip -F - <<'MSG'
feat(ui): concise example

Body
MSG
```



# Rust Development Guidelines

## General Guidelines

- Use Rust edition 2024.
- Avoid including code examples in documentation comments.
- Always introduce items from the standard library with a `use` declaration at
  the top of the file; do not reference `std` paths directly in the code body.
- Functions should not be nested inside other functions except in extremely
  rare cases where necessary.
- You should amost never add dead_code annotations. If you find yourself doing
  this, default to removing the code instead, unless there's a very good reason.
- Avoid feature gating unless absolutely necessary.
- Avoid configuring tests or any code component with environment variables. Prefer
  using function parameters or configuration structs.
- Avoid adding trivial accessor methods. For example:
    ```rust
    struct Foo {
        bar: Bar,
    }

    impl Foo {
        // DO NOT DO THIS. It's fine for the user to access foo.bar.name() directly.
        fn name(&self) -> String {
            self.bar.name()
        }

        // DO NOT DO THIS. It's fine for the user to access foo.bar directly.
        fn bar(&self) -> &Bar {
            &self.bar
        }
    }
    ```
- Avoid renaming items in `use` with `as` unless absolutely necessary. Aliasing
  makes code hard to read and understand. To disambiguate, consider importing
  the module instead and reference the item via its path (for example,
  `pane::Close`) so readers can immediately see where a symbol originates.


## Crate structure

- Every crate that has methods that return `Result` should have a custom error
  type defined in `error.rs`, using `thiserror`.
- Each `lib.rs` file should contain the following lints:

```rust
#![warn(missing_docs)]
```

## Linting

Before committing, ensure all code passes lint checks and all warnings are
addressed. Run:

```bash
cargo clippy -q --fix --all --all-targets --all-features --allow-dirty --tests --examples 2>&1
```

Clippy outputs warnings to stderr, which we merge into stdout so all messages
appear together. Resolve any lingering warnings manually. 

When addressing lint warnings, always step back and see if a deeper fix is
required. Sometimes the lints reveal bugs and weaknesses that should be
repaired. 

- If there are many lines of warnings, do fixes in batches  re-running clippy
  after each batch. Iterate through batches autonomously until all warnings are
  done.
- Do NOT simply allow lints without the user's OK - the lints are configured
  for a reason, and simply over-riding them should be very rare.
- When asked to de-nest deep functions or reduce function complexity, look at
  the function as a whole, and try to logically decompose it in a reusable way. 
- When warned about a result not being used, evaluate whether it SHOULD be used
  (i.e. if it's an error that should be handled), or a value that might be
  important. Do not simply assign to underscore unless it's warranted.
- Run unit tests to ensure that the project still works after every batch.


## Formatting

If you have nightly available, and `rustfmt-nightly.toml` format code with:


```bash
cargo +nightly fmt --all -- --config-path ./rustfmt-nightly.toml
```

Otherwise, format with:

```bash
cargo +nightly fmt --all
```

ALWAYS format before committing.

## Testing

After completing changes, execute all tests using:

```bash
cargo nextest run --all --all-features
```

If nextest is not installed, fall back to:

```bash
cargo test --all --all-features
```

Tests should always be placed in a "test" module when colocated with code.
There should only ever be a single test module per file. 

## Dependencies

Add dependencies by using the following command rather than editing
`Cargo.toml` directly:

```bash
cargo add <crate_name>
```

When adding a new dependency, do NOT specify a version unless absolutely
necessary. This will mean we pick up the latest version of the crate.

## Ruskel Tool Usage

The **ruskel** command-line utility generates Rust skeletons displaying the API
structure of crates, modules, structs, traits, functions, or any Rust
path—omitting implementation bodies. This tool is useful for reviewing names,
type signatures, derives, and documentation comments during code writing or
review. Always prefer ruskel over other inspection methods for Rust code.

Before any significant tool call (such as invoking ruskel), state in one line
the purpose and minimal required inputs.

Ruskel has to compile all dependencies, so the first run may take a while - run
the command with an extended timeout (e.g., 120 seconds) if needed. 

### When to Use ruskel
- Look up signatures or definitions of functions, traits, or structs.
- Explore public or private APIs.
- Find specific examples or crate documentation are needed.
- When you are searching through a crate for keywords or concepts.

### ruskel Usage Tips
- Request deep module paths (e.g., `ruskel tokio::sync::mpsc`) to stay within your
  token budget.
- Use the `ruskel --private` flag to view non-public items, which can be useful for
  nspecting your current codebase.

### Search

Ruskel has powerful search capabilities that lets you search for keywords
across crates using the `--search` flag. Here are the relevant flags:

```
      --search <SEARCH>
          Search query used to filter the generated skeleton instead of rendering everything

      --list
          Output a structured item listing instead of rendered code

      --search-spec <DOMAIN[,DOMAIN...]>
          Comma-separated list of search domains (name, doc, signature, path). Defaults to name, doc,
          signature

          Possible values:
          - name:      Match against item names
          - doc:       Match against documentation comments
          - path:      Match against canonical module paths
          - signature: Match against rendered signatures

          [default: name,doc,signature]

      --search-case-sensitive
          Execute the search in a case sensitive manner
```


#### Examples

```sh
# Inspect the current project
ruskel

# Query a standard library trait
ruskel std::io::Read

# In a workspace with a crate 'mycrate'
ruskel mycrate

# View a method on a struct in the current crate
ruskel mycrate::Struct::method

# Explore a dependency or fetch from crates.io if not present
ruskel serde

# Look within a crate's module
ruskel serde::de::Deserialize

# Via filesystem path
ruskel /my/path

# Sub-module within a path
ruskel /my/path::foo

# Specific dependency version from crates.io
ruskel serde@1.0.0

# Search for "status" in the reqwest crate, matching names, signatures and doc comments
ruskel reqwest --search status 

# Search for "status" in the reqwest crate, matching only names and signatures 
ruskel reqwest --search status --search-spec name,signature

# Search for "status" in the reqwest crate, matching docs only
ruskel reqwest --search status --search-spec doc
```
