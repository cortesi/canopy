/// This is the UI the interface that all nodes must implement in Canopy.
///
/// Some explanation is necessary to justify the split between .layout() and .render(). Why not
/// just combine these two methods into a single .draw() method? The reason is that nodes need to
/// be able to account for the size of their children when laying themselves out. Imagine, for
/// instance, a text container that wraps text and resizes itself to fit. The parent needs to be
/// aware of the resulting size BEFORE it can decide where to place the child and render itself.
/// Our solution is to split rendering and layout. During the layout phase, no drawing is done, but
/// all nodes have their size and position determined. We do this by asking each node what their
/// size would be IF they had to draw within a given target area. The result can be larger or
/// smaller than the target, but gives the node the opportunity to do things like reflow text with
/// a width constraint, and then tell the parent how much space it needs. During the render phase,
/// size and position are fixed, and nodes only draw themselves to the screen.
///
/// Another key aspect of the design is that all rendering and layout happens with respect to the
/// node's own canvas. Nodes don't have to (and can't) know where they are being drawn on the
/// physical screen.
